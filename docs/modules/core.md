# core

The `core` module (main.py, config.py, container.py) is the application's entry point and composition root: `config.py` defines all runtime settings, `container.py` wires every repository/service/scorer/enricher into a single `Container`, and `main.py` builds the FastAPI app around that container, sitting above the whole pipeline (domain -> repositories -> scrapers -> scoring/backtest -> discovery/enrichment -> digest -> api) and gluing every other module together.

## backend/main.py
FastAPI application factory and ASGI entry point (run via `uvicorn backend.main:app`).

- `create_app() -> FastAPI` — builds a `Container` and initializes its DB schema, constructs the `FastAPI` app, adds permissive CORS middleware for the local Vite dev origins, mounts the `/api` router from `backend.api.routes.build_router(container)`, and (if a built frontend exists at `frontend/dist`) mounts it as static files at `/` for production/Docker serving.
- `app = create_app()` — module-level singleton FastAPI instance that ASGI servers (uvicorn) import and serve.

## backend/config.py
Defines the single `Settings` dataclass that centralizes every configurable value (paths, scoring knobs, provider budgets, secrets), read from environment variables with defaults, plus a loader function.

- `Settings` — frozen dataclass holding all application configuration: DB location (`db_path`/`database_url`), data/output directories and seed data file paths, scoring/backtest knobs (`flag_threshold`, `recency_window_days`, `digest_size`), live discovery run limits (`discovery_seed_limit`, `discovery_max_per_seed`, `collaboration_promotion_cap`, `discovery_include_fellowship_seeds`), enrichment provider credentials and budgets (PDL/Coresignal keys, monthly/daily/per-run caps and search split), email delivery settings (Resend API key, from-address, public base URL, cron secret), and server-side auth (`environment`, `admin_secret`, `owner_test_email`).
  - `Settings.is_production` (property) — returns `True` when `environment` is `"production"` or `"prod"` (case-insensitive).
  - `Settings.validate_security() -> None` — raises `RuntimeError` if running in production without either `admin_secret` or `cron_secret` configured, preventing an unsecured production deployment.
- `load_settings() -> Settings` — instantiates `Settings()`, triggering all the environment-variable-backed default factories.

## backend/container.py
Defines `Container`, the dependency-injection composition root that constructs the database connection, every repository, every domain service/engine, and wires them together in dependency order; `backend/main.py` and standalone scripts each construct exactly one `Container` (no global singletons).

- `Container` — holds one fully-wired instance of the application's dependency graph, exposed as plain attributes (e.g. `container.candidate_service`, `container.digest_generator`) that `backend/api/routes.py` reads directly.
  - `Container.__init__(settings=None)` — the wiring sequence: (1) loads/validates `Settings` and opens the `Database` (SQLite or Postgres via `database_url`), initializing its schema; (2) constructs all `*Repository` objects (persons, signals, candidate_reviews, edges, concentrations, digests, page_views, subscribers, digest_sends, feedback, enrichment_cache/usage, provider_identities) each wrapping `self.db`; (3) builds core engines — `ScoringEngine`, `EntityResolver` (over persons/signals/edges), `ContactEnricher`, `LocationResolver`; (4) builds the enrichment provider chain (`build_provider_chain(settings)`), a `ProviderBudget`, and layers `ProviderEnricher`/`ProviderExpander` on top of the chain, cache, budget, and identity repository; (5) builds higher-level services that consume the above — `CandidateService` (persons/signals/edges/engine/threshold/reviews), `CandidateReviewService`, `BacktestRunner`, `ConcentrationDetector`, `DigestGenerator` (wraps `CandidateService`), `ResendSender` and `EmailActionSigner` (secret is `admin_secret` or `cron_secret`), `SubscriberDigestService` (composes subscribers, digest_sends, candidate_service, email_sender, base URL, and the action signer); (6) finally builds `DiscoveryJobManager`, passing it a `container_factory` closure that creates a *fresh* `Container` (recursive, using the same `settings`) for each discovery job run so background jobs get isolated DB connections/state.
