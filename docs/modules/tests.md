# Tests

These files verify graph-expansion/scoring behavior, the subscriber digest pipeline and its API endpoints, small polish-phase API/CLI behaviors, the multi-provider enrichment and provider-search discovery chain, and public-release security gating (auth, secret exposure, fail-closed config).

## tests/test_graph_expansion_deepening.py
Covers GitHub REST call shaping, niche-repo surface-based graph expansion (stargazers/forkers/issue-PR interactions), Devpost/Semantic Scholar collaboration promotion with repeat-metadata, discovery-vs-founder scoring compounding, and opt-in idempotent fellowship seed loading, using fake GitHub/Devpost/Scholar clients (`FakeGithubClient`, `FakeDevpost`, `FakeScholarClient`, `RecordingSession`) against a temp SQLite `Container`.

- `test_github_client_uses_direct_capped_rest_endpoints()` — asserts `GithubClient` hits the exact stargazers/forks/issues REST endpoints with correct `per_page` limits and issue `state=all`.
- `test_graph_expansion_adds_precise_niche_repo_surfaces()` — asserts `GraphExpander.expand()` on a niche (low-star) repo adds `starred_repo`/`forked_repo`/`issue_pr_interaction` edges (not `mutual_star`) pointing candidate -> seed, using the configured per-surface limits.
- `test_collaboration_promotes_devpost_and_scholar_with_repeat_metadata()` — asserts `CollaborationExpander.expand()` promotes both a repeat Devpost hackathon teammate and a Semantic Scholar co-author, tagging repeat-project edges with `metadata["repeat"] == 2` and linking all edges to their new `target_person_id`.
- `test_discovery_scoring_compounds_distinct_surfaces_but_founders_do_not()` — asserts `ScoringEngine.connection_signal()` applies a `surface_bonus` of 0.2 for discoveries with 3+ distinct connection edge types but 0.0 for founders, and that a repeated edge (`metadata["repeat"]=2`) yields `best_quality == 1.0`.
- `test_fellowship_seed_loader_is_opt_in_and_idempotent()` — asserts `FellowshipSeedLoader.load()` creates exactly one `fellowship_cohort` edge and one `cohort="seed"` person on first run, and produces no duplicates on a second run.

## tests/test_phase4_digest.py
Covers subscriber subscribe/upsert semantics, digest delivery (send-once, dry-run preview, HTML/plain-text via `ResendSender`), and the digest-related API routes (test-send, signup, feedback, unsubscribe, cron auth) via a `TestClient` against `build_router`.

- `test_subscribe_upserts_without_changing_token()` — asserts re-subscribing the same (case-insensitive) email keeps the same id/unsubscribe token but updates frequency and preferences.
- `test_successful_delivery_records_and_never_repeats()` — asserts `deliver()` sends once (status `"sent"`), records the send so a second call returns `"empty"`, and the message body/footer contain the candidate's evidence text and feedback/unsubscribe links.
- `test_dry_run_does_not_consume_candidate()` — asserts a `dry_run=True` delivery returns `"preview"` status and does not record the candidate as sent.
- `test_resend_sender_uses_html_and_plain_text_transport()` — asserts `ResendSender.send()` posts both HTML and plain-text bodies with a 15s timeout and returns the Resend message id.
- `test_test_digest_endpoint_sends_to_verified_subscriber()` — asserts `POST /api/digest/test` (admin-authorized) sends to a signed-up subscriber and reports the correct candidate count.
- `test_test_digest_endpoint_reports_unconfigured_sender()` — asserts the test-digest endpoint returns 503 with a clear message when no sender is configured, and records no send.
- `test_test_digest_endpoint_rejects_unknown_subscriber()` — asserts requesting a test digest for an unknown email returns 401 and sends nothing.
- `test_test_digest_endpoint_rate_limits_for_24_hours()` — asserts a second test-digest request for the same subscriber within 24 hours returns 429 and only one email is ever sent.
- `test_signup_feedback_unsubscribe_and_cron_auth()` — asserts subscriber signup never returns the raw token, seed accounts parse correctly, `/api/digest/cron` requires bearer auth, and feedback/unsubscribe endpoints require a GET confirmation step before the POST actually records the vote/unsubscribe.

## tests/test_phase5_polish.py
Covers the minimal-field analytics page-view endpoint and the `build_db.py --if-empty` CLI behavior of never overwriting existing seeded data.

- `test_page_view_endpoint_stores_only_minimal_fields()` — asserts `POST /api/analytics/page-view` stores exactly `{id, path, viewed_at, referrer}` and nothing else.
- `test_page_view_rejects_absolute_external_urls()` — asserts posting an absolute external URL as `path` is rejected with 422.
- `test_if_empty_seed_does_not_replace_existing_people()` — runs `scripts/build_db.py --if-empty` as a subprocess twice (inserting a manual row between runs) and asserts the second run leaves the manually inserted row and existing count untouched, only the initial seed count remains constant.

## tests/test_provider_diversification.py
Fixture-driven tests (HTTP layer mocked, providers faked; never spend real credits) covering the PDL->Coresignal enrichment chain (caching, budgets, fallback, fail-soft outages), provider-search discovery (no-GitHub candidates, cross-provider dedupe/merge, pagination checkpointing, evidence-tier classification), adapter allowlisting/escaping for PDL and Coresignal query builders, raw HTTP response mapping for both adapters, and an unchanged-founder-backtest regression guard.

- `test_cache_prevents_repeat_calls_within_ttl()` — asserts a second `enrich()` call for the same person returns no new signals and the provider is called only once (served from cache).
- `test_cached_miss_is_not_refetched()` — asserts a definitive no-match is cached so the provider isn't called again on retry.
- `test_pdl_miss_falls_through_to_coresignal()` — asserts a clean PDL miss falls through to Coresignal and the outcome reports `fallback=True`.
- `test_confident_pdl_match_does_not_reach_coresignal()` — asserts a successful PDL match short-circuits the chain so Coresignal is never called (no double charge).
- `test_provider_outage_is_failsoft_and_not_cached()` — asserts an HTTP-error outage does not raise, is not cached (retryable), and stops the chain without calling the next provider.
- `test_budget_stops_cleanly()` — asserts once the monthly enrich-lane budget is exhausted, further runs return `"skipped"` (not an error) without calling the provider.
- `test_founder_gets_contacts_but_no_scored_signals()` — asserts enriching a founder merges contact info but emits zero scored signals (backtest protection).
- `test_dry_run_spends_nothing()` — asserts `dry_run=True` never calls the provider, never caches, and never records usage.
- `test_sqlite_workers_do_not_share_connection()` — asserts two threads get distinct SQLite connection objects (thread-local connections).
- `test_legacy_provider_identity_backfill_is_idempotent()` — asserts constructing a `PersonRepository` backfills `discovery_origin` for legacy provider-linked people (`provider_search` vs `github`) and is stable across repeated construction.
- `test_search_creates_candidate_without_github()` — asserts `ProviderExpander.expand()` creates a discovery-cohort person with no GitHub username, a resolved LinkedIn URL, `discovery_lane="provider_search"`, and at least one evidence signal.
- `test_duplicate_provider_records_merge()` — asserts a second `expand()` call for an already-completed, checkpointed page creates no new people and makes no extra search calls.
- `test_dedupe_across_providers_by_linkedin()` — asserts the same person returned by two different providers (matched by LinkedIn URL) is merged into one person, counted as a duplicate.
- `test_pagination_resumes_next_page_without_repeating()` — asserts successive `expand()` calls advance the search cursor page-by-page without repeating results, and the checkpoint records total pages/records and exhaustion.
- `test_review_tier_emits_only_dated_education()` — asserts a record with no positions/undated profile is classified `evidence_tier="review"`, flagged `review_required`, and only an `education_signal` is emitted.
- `test_verified_tier_requires_dated_movement()` — asserts a record with dated position/education movement is classified `evidence_tier="verified"` with `review_required=False`.
- `test_recent_technical_education_is_selected_over_undated_entry()` — asserts the person's `school` field picks a recent, dated technical-education entry over an undated business-school entry.
- `test_undated_technical_education_is_rejected()` — asserts a record whose only education entry is undated is rejected with reason `undated_or_stale_education`.
- `test_search_error_is_audited_without_advancing_or_spending()` — asserts a provider search HTTP error is recorded in the checkpoint (`error_count`, `last_outcome`) without advancing the page or consuming search-lane usage.
- `test_queue_prioritizes_high_scoring_github_only_candidates()` — asserts `ProviderEnricher.prioritize()` orders pending GitHub-only candidates by descending score.
- `test_enrichment_statuses_cover_match_miss_error_and_budget()` — asserts `enrichment_status` is set correctly for matched, no-match, error, and budget-exhausted (`pending_budget`) outcomes.
- `test_candidate_payload_exposes_rebalance_metadata()` — asserts `CandidateService.list_candidates()` payload surfaces `discovery_origin`, `evidence_status`/`evidence_tier`, `review_required`, and `enrichment_status`.
- `test_low_confidence_records_rejected()` — asserts an ambiguous record (no LinkedIn, single-token name, no evidence) is rejected and creates no person.
- `test_search_dry_run_spends_nothing()` — asserts a dry-run search expansion creates no people, makes no provider calls, writes no checkpoints, and records no usage.
- `test_search_budget_limits_records()` — asserts the number of created people from a search run never exceeds the computed search-lane budget cap.
- `test_pdl_search_where_is_allowlisted_and_escaped()` — asserts `PdlProvider._build_where()` escapes single quotes, converts list filters to `IN (...)`, and silently drops unknown/unallowlisted filter keys (e.g. SQL-injection-shaped values).
- `test_pdl_escape_strips_control_chars()` — asserts `PdlProvider._escape()` correctly escapes quotes and strips newlines.
- `test_coresignal_filters_are_allowlisted()` — asserts `CoresignalProvider._build_filters()` maps only allowlisted keys (school/location) and drops unknown ones.
- `test_pdl_enrich_maps_200_and_handles_404_and_error()` — asserts `PdlProvider.enrich_person()` maps a 200 response to a populated `EnrichmentResult`, treats 404 as a clean cacheable miss (`last_error=None`), and treats 401 as a non-cacheable error (`last_error="HTTP 401"`).
- `test_pdl_search_page_uses_persistable_offset()` — asserts `PdlProvider.search_page()` sends the correct `from` offset and returns correct `returned_records`/`credit_units`/`exhausted` values.
- `test_coresignal_search_page_offsets_collects_and_counts_requests()` — asserts `CoresignalProvider.search_page()` tracks API request/credit counts across a paginated collect-then-detail-fetch flow and resumes correctly from a serialized cursor.
- `test_founder_backtest_unchanged()` — regression guard asserting the founder backtest recall (`70.0%`) and false-positive rate (`1.7%`) are unchanged against the real seeded `signal_scout.db` (skipped if that DB or founders aren't present).

## tests/test_public_release_security.py
Covers that candidate browsing stays public while operator/admin routes are bearer-gated, that admin preview does not record a real send, that public signup never leaks the subscriber's action token, and that production config fails closed when secrets are missing.

- `test_candidate_browsing_is_public_but_operator_routes_are_gated()` — asserts `/api/candidates` and `/api/overview` are public (200) while discovery/digest-preview/candidate-reviews/digest-generate routes all return 401 without auth.
- `test_admin_bearer_allows_preview_without_recording_send()` — asserts an admin-authorized `/api/digest/preview` request returns the expected approved candidate but does not record it as sent to the subscriber.
- `test_public_signup_does_not_expose_action_token()` — asserts `POST /api/subscribers` response never includes `subscriber_token`.
- `test_production_operator_configuration_fails_closed()` — asserts constructing a `Container` with `environment="production"` and empty `admin_secret`/`cron_secret` raises `RuntimeError` mentioning `ADMIN_SECRET`.
